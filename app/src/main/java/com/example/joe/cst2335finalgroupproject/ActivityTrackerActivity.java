     * Priorities for each Activity (suggested complete in this order in case Prof
     * pulls us for review with no warning.)
     *
     * Milestone 1 (Must be demonstrated December 7th):
     *          3.	Each Activity must have a ListView to present items. Selecting an item from the ListView must show detailed information about the item selected.
     *          7.	Each activity must have at least 1 button
     *          8.	Each activity must have at least 1 edit text with appropriate text input method.
     * Milestone 2 (Must be demonstrated December 14th):
     *          2.	Each Activity must use a fragment in its graphical interface.
     *          5.	Each activity must use an AsyncTask in the code. This can be to open a Database, retrieve data from a server, save data, or any other reasonable circumstance.
     *          6.	Each activity must have at least 1 progress bar
     *          9.	Each activity must have at least 1 Toast, Snackbar, and custom dialog notification.

     * Milestone 3 (Must be demonstrated December 21st):
     *          1.  The software must have 1 different activity written by each person in your group. The activity must be accessible by selecting a graphical icon from a Toolbar.
     *          4.  The items listed in the ListView must be stored by the application so that appear the next time the application is launched. The user must be able to add and delete items, which would then also be stored.
     *          10.	A help menu item that displays a dialog with the author’s name, Activity version number, and instructions for how to use the interface.
     *          11.	There must be at least 1 other language supported by your Activity. If you are not bilingual, then you must support both British and American English (words like colour, color, neighbour, neighbor, etc).
     *          If you know a language other than English, then you can support that language in your application and don’t need to support American English.
     *
     * Activity Specific Requirements:
     * 	The user should be able to enter physical activities they did.
     •	The user should be able to choose from 5 different activities: Running, Walking, Biking, Swimming or Skating.
     •	The user should be able to enter the amount of time in minutes they did the activity.
     •	The user should also be able to add comment, like “This felt easy”, or “My knee hurts after 10 minutes”. The database should track what time the activity was entered.
     •	You should use fragments to show a ListView displays the activities, either ordered by time or as a daily summary of activities and time exercising. Users should be able to delete or edit previous entries, like changing the activity type or time spent, or change comments.
     •	The application should calculate how many minutes of activity the user does per month, and also show how much activity the user did last month.
